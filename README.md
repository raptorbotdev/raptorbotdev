# 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Systems Engineer passionate about building modern, scalable web applications.

My main focus is **React development**, where I design clean, maintainable, and high-performance interfaces.  
I also work across the full stack — developing backend APIs and integrating AI-driven solutions into real-world platforms.

I continuously improve my system design thinking, architecture skills, and performance optimization strategies.

> I build with structure. I grow with purpose.

# ⚛️ React — My Core Strength

React is the technology where I feel most confident and motivated.

## What I Build with React

```diff
+ Scalable component-based architectures
+ Reusable custom hooks
+ Context API state management
+ Performance optimization (memo, lazy loading)
+ Clean folder structure & maintainable code
+ API integration with robust error handling
+ UX-driven and responsive interfaces
```

### My React Mindset

- Think in components  
- Prioritize reusability  
- Keep state predictable  
- Optimize performance early  
- Build for long-term scalability

# ⚙️ Full Stack Development

On the backend, I work with:

```diff
+ Node.js & Express
+ RESTful API design
+ MongoDB & MySQL
+ Authentication & validation
+ Clean backend architecture
```

I enjoy connecting robust backend systems with intuitive frontend experiences.

# 🧠 AI & Data Integration

I integrate intelligent systems into web platforms through:

```diff
+ Machine Learning model integration
+ Data analysis & visualization
+ Intelligent automation
+ AI-powered web applications
```

My goal is to bridge intelligent systems with scalable web architecture.
