# 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Systems Engineer with a strong passion for building scalable, modern web applications.

My main focus is **React development**, where I design clean, maintainable, and performance-driven interfaces.  
I also work across the full stack — developing backend APIs and integrating AI-driven systems into real-world platforms.

I believe software must be structured, scalable, and built with long-term vision.

# ⚛️ React — My Core Strength

```diff
+ Scalable component-based architecture
+ Custom reusable hooks
+ Context API state management
+ Performance optimization (memo, lazy loading)
+ API integration with clean abstraction
+ UX-driven and responsive interfaces
```

React is where I combine logic, performance, and design precision.

# ⚙️ Full Stack & AI Integration

```diff
+ Node.js & Express backend systems
+ RESTful API design
+ MongoDB & MySQL
+ Authentication & validation
+ Machine Learning model integration
+ Data visualization & intelligent automation
```

I enjoy connecting intelligent backend systems with intuitive frontend experiences.
